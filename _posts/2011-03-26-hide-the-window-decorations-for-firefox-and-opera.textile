title: Hide the window decorations for firefox and opera
---

I've found a way to hide window decorations in metacity for Opera and Firefox:

* install devilspie
* create files opera.ds and firefox.ds in your ~/.devilspie directory with the following content:

bc. (if (is (application_name) "Firefox") and (contains (window_name) "Mozilla Firefox")
             (begin
                (undecorate)
             )
)

bc. (if (is (application_name) "Opera") and (is (window_name) "Opera")
             (begin
                (undecorate)
             )
)

* run devilspie and check if everything works
* place devilspie in autostart

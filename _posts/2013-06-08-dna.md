## Human genome

[Human genome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome) consists of 23 pairs of [chromosomes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome).

Each chromosome pair, except of the 23d is identified by its number (1-22). The 23d pair is named as XX or XY, and identifies the gender.

Each chromosome is a [DNA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dna) &mdash; a double helix shaped molecule, consisting of a long sequence of [base](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleobase) pairs.

A base is a "letter" of DNA. There are four possible bases in the DNA: [ACGT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACGT) (Adenine, Cytosine, Guanine and Thymine).

There are different number of basepairs in each of the chromosome (more than 6 billion total).

Some parts of base pairs sequence make up a [gene](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene) &mdash; a logical unit that scientists relate to a specific function. There are roughly 20000 genes in the human genome. Each gene is located in its dedicated [locus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_(genetics)) &mdash; its "coordinates" in the genome.

The genes is a blueprint of how to produce a specific [protein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein). Slight variations of the gene can lead to a different protein being produced.

title: Interface and abstract class in C++

What is the difference between interface and abstract class in C++?

Quote from "C++ Programming/Classes/Abstract Classes / Wikibooks":http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C++_Programming/Classes/Abstract_Classes:

bq.. "An abstract class is, conceptually, a class that cannot be instantiated and is usually implemented as a class that has one or more pure virtual (abstract) functions.

...

The concept of interface is mapped to pure abstract classes in C++, as there is no construction "interface" in C++ the same way that there is in Java."

p. So, interface in Java is a pure abstract class in C++.
